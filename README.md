# GAP: Pairing gap calculator

GAP is a program written in Python 3 to calculate the paring gap in nuclei using a 5 point interpolation.

The interpolation method was taken from Mang et al (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/0029-5582(65)90564-X).

Masses are read from the latest Atomic Mass Evaluation (https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/).
